# Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities & Postural Transitions

##  Project Overview
This project aims to classify human activities and postural transitions using smartphone sensor data. The dataset used is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: [Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities & Postural Transitions](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/341/smartphone+based+recognition+of+human+activities+and+postural+transitions). The dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope readings collected from a smartphone placed on subjects performing various activities.

### Why This Project?
Human activity recognition (HAR) has applications in **healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart environments**. By classifying activities such as walking, standing, and sitting, we can develop intelligent applications that assist users in daily life. This project focuses on training and optimizing machine learning models to **accurately classify human activities** based on smartphone sensor data.

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
### **1.Loading and Normalizing the Data**
- The dataset is loaded from `dataset/Train/` and `dataset/Test/`.
- Features are normalized to a range between **0 and 1**.

### **2.Initial Data Visualization**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand feature distributions.
- Data was visualized to analyze activity-wise feature separation.

## Initial Model Training
Three baseline models were trained to establish a starting point:

| Model             | Accuracy (%) |
|------------------|-------------|
| Decision Tree    | 60.56       |
| k-NN (k=5)      | 87.25       |
| SVM (Linear)    | 89.88       |

- **k-NN and SVM performed well**, but Decision Tree had low accuracy.

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Selection
We experimented with different approaches to improve model performance:

### **1.Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **k-NN**: We tested different values of **k** and found **k=7** optimal.
- **SVM**: We experimented with different kernel functions (`linear`, `polynomial`, `rbf`) and values of **C (Regularization Parameter)**.

### **2.Feature Selection Experiments**
We attempted multiple feature selection strategies:
1. **Top 20 Features** â†’ Slight improvement in Decision Tree, but **k-NN and SVM accuracy dropped**.
2. **Top 30 Features** â†’ Improved **k-NN accuracy**, but SVM performance dropped significantly.
3. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** â†’ Selected **560 most relevant features**, improving overall accuracy.

---

## Final Model Selection & Evaluation
After performing **RFE-based feature selection** and **advanced hyperparameter tuning**, the final model was trained using **SVM with C=10 and a linear kernel**.

### **Final Model Performance:**
| Model             | Accuracy (%) |
|------------------|-------------|
| Final SVM Model (C=10, Linear) | 91.77 |

#### Confusion Matrix:
- The confusion matrix revealed strong classification performance, especially in static activities.
- Some misclassification occurred in transitions like `sit-to-stand` and `stand-to-lie`.

#### **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:**
These metrics provided additional insights into per-class performance, helping analyze strengths and weaknesses.
